# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


- [x] Set-up React
- [x] Tailwind and DaisyUI
- [x] Set-up Graphql
- [] Decide which API to use
- [] Do I need a .env file??
- [] Decide on a database (SQl or Nosql??)
- [] Set-up Go Backend
- [] User Auth (Haven't decided how yet)
